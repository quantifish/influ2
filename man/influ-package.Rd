\title{Influence in linear models}
\description{
A package for generating step plots, influence plots, CDI plots, and influence metrics for a linear model
}
\details{
The concept of influence in generalised linear models is described in 
Bentley, N., Kendrick, T. H., Starr, P. J., & Breen, P. A. (2011). Influence plots and metrics: tools for better understanding fisheries catch-per-unit-effort standardisations.
This package provides an implementation of the plots and metrics described in that paper. ICES Journal of Marine Science, doi:10.1093/icesjms/fsr174.

Currently, this package works for \code{glm} models with log transformed dependent variables. These
are the type of models commonly used for one part of the delta-lognormal approach to catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE)
standardisation. e.g.\code{ model = glm(log(catch)~year+month+vessel+effort)}
In time, the package may be generalised to other types of models (e.g. \code{gam}s) and other types of dependent variables.

This document provides minimal documentation and the best way to learn how to use this package is through the vignette:
 "An example of how to use the 'influ' package"
