  hurdle = FALSE,

}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{An object of class \code{brmsfit}.}

\item{xfocus}{The column name of the variable to be plotted on the x axis. 
This column name must match one of the column names in the 
\code{data.frame} that was passed to \code{brm} as the \code{data} argument.}

\item{yfocus}{The column name of the variable to be plotted on the y axis. 
This column name must match one of the column names in the 
\code{data.frame} that was passed to \code{brm} as the \code{data} argument. 
This is generally the temporal variable in a generalised linear model (e.g. year).}

\item{xlab}{The x axis label.}

\item{ylab}{The y axis label.}

\item{hurdle}{If a hurdle model then use the hurdle.}

\item{sort_coefs}{Should the coefficients be sorted from highest to lowest.}

\item{axis.text.x.bl}{Include the x axis labels on the bottom-left (bl) bubble plot panel.}

\item{colour}{The colour to use in the plot.}

\item{p_margin}{The margin between panels on the plot. This is passed to \code{margin} within \code{theme}.}

\item{legend}{To show the legend or not.}

\item{sum_by}{Sum to 1 by row, sum to 1 by column, sum to 1 across all data, or raw. The size of the bubbles will be 
the same for all and raw, but the legend will change from numbers of records to a proportion.}

\item{...}{Further arguments passed to nothing.}
}
\value{
a \code{ggplot} object.
}
\description{
The CDI plot presents the coefficients for the variable of interest (top-left panel), the spread of the data 
(bottom-left panel), and the influence statistic (bottom-right panel).
